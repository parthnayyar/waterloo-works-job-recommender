The IP Cores we develop include Memory Interfaces (such as DDR5, LPDDR5, or HBM), custom chip-to-chip interfaces for high-speed ADC/DAC tiles (for radar processing), and leading-edge transceiver interfaces (to enable Ethernet, PCIe, and other protocols). Altera's IP cores provide configurable access to these high-speed, high-bandwidth interfaces, leveraging dedicated and specialized silicon subsystems in the FPGA. The constantly rising speed and complexity of memory devices, chip-to-chip, and transceiver interfaces presents a challenging design problem that requires system level knowledge of silicon, software, IP, and customer applications. As an IP Design Engineering Intern, you will work with a team of engineers to develop and verify state-of-the-art memory interface, chip-to-chip, or transceiver-based IP cores. You will be working on advanced device architectures, design definition, implementation, and verification. You will also be developing design examples and simulation models, accompanied by a rich set of technical documentation<br>","Job Title":"FPGA NIOS V - Hardware Developer","Job Type":"Co-op Main","Level":"<table>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td class=\"np-view-question--15\">Intermediate</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td class=\"np-view-question--15\">Senior</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n</tbody></table>","Number of Job Openings":"1","Region":"ON - Toronto","Required Skills":"The candidate should possess the following behavioral traits:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Strong skills in communication, initiative, innovation, and teamwork</li>\n\t<li>Highly motivated to learn and adapt to fast-changing technologies and environments</li>\n\t<li>Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail</li>\n\t<li>Demonstrate fundamental values such as accountability, integrity, and a winning mindset</li>\n\t<li>Collaborative mindset, strong influencing skills, and a willingness to work across geographical locations.</li>\n</ul>\nYou must possess the minimum qualifications to be initially considered for this position.

The <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2023.1319879/full\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2023.1319879/full\">UTE</a> facility at SNOLAB provides a low-background and vibrationally isolated environment for testing and operating these future devices. The successful candidate will be responsible for supporting the CUTE experimental program during the summer semester 2025. This will include hardware tasks, data analysis and/or simulation development depending on the interests of the candidate. Future experiments are expected to include an underground superconducting qubit run.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>RadioActive isotope Measurement Program at SNOLAB (RAMPS):</u></strong> The half-life from long-lived radioactive isotopes can provide fundamental information necessary for a variety of fields of physics (rare-event searches, nuclear physics, geochronology etc.). The goal of the RAMPS pilot project is to perform novel measurements of long-lived isotopes using (or enhancing) existing SNOLAB detectors. The successful candidate would be responsible for aiding in the measurement of new isotopes, analyzing data from the pilot project measurements and developing new, SiPM (Silicon Photomultiplier) based, detectors to enhance future measurements.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>Removal of Argon from Nitrogen:</u></strong> Noble gases are of considerable use in particle and astrophysics research. Frequently used as cover gases or sparging gases to either protect from potentially harmful background entering experiments or purifying systems. SNOLAB utilizes a large volume of nitrogen and argon, including in the underground liquid nitrogen plant. The problem facing SNOLAB is that the nitrogen produced underground contains an approximately 3% argon impurity that contains a radioactive isotope, <sup>39</sup>Ar, that can interfere with the experiments. Currently, two streams of research, engineering, and development are underway at SNOLAB: producing ultra-pure nitrogen by column distillation and the use of silver doped zeolites for the removal of Argon, Radon, and other impurities. Sample tasks include simulation of distillation systems, computational chemistry analysis of gas-zeolite interactions, design and construction of the distillation system, and the upscaling of zeolite test systems.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>Low background laboratory:</u></strong> The Low Background Lab student will be engaged with the operation and analysis of data from the high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, radon emanation system, alpha detector, neutron detectors, seismic/vibration sensors and other scientific instruments used within the SNOLAB material assay and screening program. In addition, characterization of the response of the detectors via Monte Carlo simulation will be performed.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>DEAP-3600:</u></strong> DEAP-3600 is a dark matter detector using liquid argon as a target material. It has been taking data between Fall 2016 and Winter 2020, reaching <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.022004\">excellent sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering</a>. During that time, some unexpected alpha backgrounds have been identified. The detector is being modified to mitigate them allowing the detector to reach its maximum sensitivity. It also serves as a test bed for newly developed techniques aiming at making argon detectors the most sensitive in the world for high-mass WIMP dark matter. The successful candidate will participate in the hardware upgrade activities, including the recommissioning of the detector, as well as data taking and data analysis.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>PICO:</u></strong> PICO operates dark matter search detectors using C3F8 which form superheated bubbles when it interacts with dark matter and/or various background particles. The project consists of the PICO-40 experiment which is currently operating and the PICO-500 experiment which is under construction. The successful candidate would be expected to take detector shifts on PICO-40, analyze data, calibrate and help in the general operation of the detector. The candidate would also help with the construction and assembly of the PICO-500 detector as needed.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>SNO+:</u></strong> SNO+ is a multipurpose neutrino detector using organic liquid scintillator to search for neutrinoless double beta decay, detect anti-neutrinos and supernova neutrinos. The detector is currently operating in its pure liquid scintillator phase and in parallel is preparing for the tellurium phase. The successful candidate will be part of the detector group working on further automating shift taking for the detector and other aspects of the experiment. In addition, the candidate will support quality assurance and maintenance tasks as needed.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>SNO+ Te Project:</u></strong> As part of the search for neutrinoless double beta decay with SNO+, two ultra-clean process plants have been constructed in the underground environment at SNOLAB. The first is a purification plant, while the second is a synthesis plant, also known as the TeDiol Plant, where the Tellurium-Butanediol complex is synthesized. The successful candidate will contribute to the final commissioning steps at the plant in preparation for the first test synthesis. They will also participate in developing a campaign to study both the properties and characteristics of the complex, as well as the final scintillator cocktail.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>SuperCDMS:</u></strong> The Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (SuperCDMS) is a direct detection dark matter search experiment that is currently being constructed 2 kilometers underground at SNOLAB. The experiment will employ 24 cryogenic semiconductor detectors and aims to achieve world-leading sensitivity for dark matter interactions in the low mass range of 0.5 GeV to 5 GeV. The successful candidate would be expected to support the on-going installation effort, be involved in the operation and testing of the SuperCDMS cryogenic system and help with any other sub-system commissioning of the experiment.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>Assay program:</u></strong> SNO+ utilizes a variety of assay systems to look for radon in the detector components, both in liquid and gas form. This is crucial for understanding the backgrounds in detail and therefore enabling the best possible physics outcomes. There are efforts to develop trapping capabilities and a new assay system utilizing scavengers. The successful candidate will be part of the assay group and learn the current systems. In addition, they will work on further developing the new systems for the experiment.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>The QA program</u></strong> for SNO+ was established to control the purity of the scintillator by testing its optical properties, e.g., UV-Vis transparency can be affected by contaminants by showing an increase in absorption. The purification plant is going through an upgrade of the main distillation process. To confirm the efficiency of the process, a QA testing campaign will be required, and the successful candidate will take part in that QA program during commissioning and operations of the purification plant. The successful candidate will also help in improving the monitoring tools for quality control of the SNOLAB cleanroom environment.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><u>Analytical Chemistry program:</u></strong> The selected candidate will join the Scientific Support Group, collaborating closely with the Chemical Technologists to provide analytical and technical support to SNOLAB and its experiments (SNO+ QA) both in the Surface Clean Lab and Underground Facility. The role involves advancing material characterization and quantification techniques using ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Infrared), including the development of a spectral library for common materials and chemicals used at SNOLAB. Additional responsibilities will include sample collection, data analysis, and trend monitoring to support the ultrapure water system and various laboratory operations.","Job Summary":"<strong>About Us</strong><br>\nSNOLAB is an international facility for world-class underground physics research.

JTS develops and implements systems for case management, digital evidence processing, and improving the delivery of legal services, with the goal of enhancing efficiency, accessibility, and fairness. By modernizing court processes and streamlining operations, JTS works to improve the overall experience for both the public and legal professionals in Ontario.<br>\n<br>\nPurpose of Position<br>\nAssisting the Regional Systems Team in the tier 2 IT support of judicial and Court Services Division clients. Helping with project implementations/rollouts, reimaging of computers, deploying new hardware and maintaining asset inventories.<br>\n<br>\nA bit about us:<br>\n<br>\nThe <strong>Justice Video Network (JVN) </strong>in Ontario is an innovative initiative that leverages video conferencing technology to make the justice system more accessible and efficient. It connects various courts, correctional facilities, and other legal stakeholders across Ontario, allowing hearings, trials, and meetings to take place remotely. This is especially helpful in rural or remote areas where physical access to courtrooms might be limited. The network is used for a wide range of legal matters, from bail hearings to witness testimony, making the entire legal process more efficient and less costly.<br>\n<br>\nWhat makes supporting the JVN through a co-op placement so cool is that you're directly contributing to an important, real-world application of technology in the legal field. You'll gain valuable experience working with cutting-edge tools that improve the justice system's accessibility, ensuring people can participate in legal proceedings even if they can't physically attend court. You'd also be helping to optimize a system that makes legal processes smoother for everyone involved-court staff, legal professionals, and the public.<br>\nAdditionally, working with the JVN offers insight into how technology and law intersect, and you'd have a chance to support a network that is essential in modernizing the justice system. It's a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in both tech and law, which can be a great advantage for future career opportunities, especially in the growing field of legal tech.<br>\n<br>\nYou'd be making a tangible difference in people's ability to access justice, and there's a sense of pride in knowing your work supports a system that impacts the daily lives of Ontarians. Plus, the opportunity to work with professionals across different sectors-tech, law enforcement, and legal practitioners-adds to the excitement and value of the experience.","Job Title":"IT Systems Assistant CO-OP","Job Type":"Co-op Main","Level":"<table>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tbody><tr>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td class=\"np-view-question--15\">Junior</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td class=\"np-view-question--15\">Intermediate</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td class=\"np-view-question--15\">Senior</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n</tbody></table>","Number of Job Openings":"2","Region":"ON -
